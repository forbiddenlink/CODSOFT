# Level 1 Task 2 Portfolio

This is the ReadMe file for the Codsoft Internship Portfolio.
This is a personal portgolio website I designed to showcase who I am and my technical skills using HTML and CSS.
The goals of this website are to:
- create a Header Section stating my name and Logo at the top with a brief introduction
- create an about section with an image of myself and a short biography
- create a skills section
- showcase samples of my work in a projects section
- provide a link to my resume in a resume section
- create a contact section
- add a footer with any additional information
 
 ## Adding this text
 just to see if my commits are working properly before I begin
